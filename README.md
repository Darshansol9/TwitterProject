# TwitterProject
This project is to extract large scales tweets of given twitter_id's atleast 1000 followers and query on them for certain statistics


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Contains 5 custom made python files.
connect_database.py
FetchTweetIds.py
private.py
Twitter_Followers.py
Twitter_Timeline.py

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Contains 2 Azure Functions and One FunctionApp:
ProjP1 - FA
GetTweets - AF
FetchFollowers -AF

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Files that were generate with tweets for each individual followers and list of followers twitter id:  Followers_List.csv
More Than 1000 files were generated and stored in Azure Database.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
WorkFlow:

FetchFollowers is an azure function which returns HTTPResponse when called through the browser.
http://localhost:7071/api/HttpTrigger?name=18839785

As we get the twitter id, inside __init__.py file
Internal calls to custom made python files are done.

Twitter_Follower.py gets called - which hits the twitter api and fetch the followers list of given Twitter_id
This list is stored inside Followers folder with name Followers_List.csv.
Twitter_Timeline.py gets called which used the Followers_List.csv file and fetch the user's timeline tweets for atleast 200 tweets.
connect_database.py gets called which connects the database and stores the data generated by twitter_timeline.py into the SQL Database of Azure.

Once this process is done, user get the response of all tweets inserted with the list of twitter_ids for the given twitter_id.


To Fetch the tweets:
GetTweets azure func is used.
This connects database, given the twitter_id which user wants to view the tweets, it makes a query on database and retrieve the response 
on the browser.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Fetching the Tweets :
GetTweets Azure Function is used
http://localhost:7071/api/GetTweets?name=1356820052
Say we want the tweets for 1356820052.
It calls connect_database_fetch.py and make a query on the database to get the tweets.
This tweets are treated as string object which is then send to browser back.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hosted the app in azure for getting the followers id for given twitter id in production environment:
Used: Narendra Modi Twitter Id - to fetch atleast 1000 followers having 200 tweets atleast.
So in total 200k tweets were stored and index on SQL Server Database to make query response time faster.
